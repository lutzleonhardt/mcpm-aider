This is a fork of [mcpm/cli](https://github.com/mcp-club/cli) with additional features for use with aider.
Treat this as an experiment on how to use MCP servers with aider without modifying aider source code UNTIL native MCP support becomes available.

There are three main components to using MCPM with aider:

1. MCP Server Management - Install and configure your MCP servers
2. Using MCP with Aider via Toolprompt - The original method using prompt-based tool descriptions
3. Using MCP with Aider via Bridge Service - A more integrated approach using an OpenAI-compatible proxy

## 1. MCP Server Management

First, you need to install and manage your MCP servers:

```bash
mcpm-aider install @jsonallen/perplexity-mcp
```

This tool is originally written to maintain MCP servers for Claude App. You need to ensure the Claude config file is in the correct path:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Boiler plate:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
  }
}
```

Consult Claude docs or install Claude Desktop App if you encounter any issues.

Most of the time you also need to install the dependencies of the MCP server (check the README of the MCP server). For example:

```bash
# Ubuntu
pipx install perplexity-mcp
# Windows/MacOS
uv pip install perplexity-mcp
```

## 2. Using MCP with Aider via Toolprompt

⚠️ **Important: This method requires Aider's `/code` mode**

The toolprompt method generates bash commands in the format `mcpm-aider call <tool> <function> '<params>'` for the LLM to execute. Aider's `/code` mode is required to automatically execute these bash commands. Without `/code` mode, Aider will interpret the code fences as file edits instead of shell commands, resulting in errors.

Using the `--yes` flag when starting Aider enables automatic command execution without confirmation prompts.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Start Aider with the `--yes` flag:**
   ```bash
   aider --yes
   ```

2. **Switch to `/code` mode:**
   ```
   /code
   ```

3. **Generate the tool prompt:**
   ```
   /run mcpm-aider toolprompt
   ```

4. **Ask the LLM to use a tool:**
   ```
   Please ask perplexity about the sense of life
   ```
   
   The LLM will parse your request and automatically execute the appropriate tool call using `mcpm-aider call`.

### What Happens Without `/code` Mode?

If you don't use `/code` mode, you'll encounter errors like:
```
The LLM did not conform to the edit format.
No filename provided before ``` in file listing
```

This happens because Aider's default mode interprets code fences as file edit blocks (SEARCH/REPLACE format), not as shell commands to execute. Since the LLM generates bash commands wrapped in code fences, Aider tries to parse them as file edits and fails.

## 3. Using MCP with Aider via Bridge Service

A more elegant approach is to use the new MCP-Bridge, which creates an OpenAI-compatible proxy that handles tool calls:

```bash
mcpm-aider start-bridge
```

This starts a local Python service that:
1. Automatically syncs Python dependencies using UV
2. Creates an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint on port 8000
3. Handles tool calls directly without needing to generate tool prompts
4. Returns results back to the AI assistant

**Requirements:** The MCP-Bridge requires UV package manager to be installed on your system. If UV is not detected, instructions for installation will be shown.

### Configuration

The bridge service can use different inference servers by providing the `--server` option:

```bash
mcpm-aider start-bridge --server https://api.openai.com/v1/
```

The proxy uses the API key it receives from the caller as a header, so you don't need to set up API keys in MCPM. This allows you to keep using your existing API keys while benefiting from MCP tool functionality.

Hint: AFAIK this is NOT working with Openrouter as they do not support tool calling with their OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

### Example Configurations for Aider

#### 1. OpenAI o3-mini

Inference URL: https://api.openai.com/v1/

Configure in `~/.aider.model.settings.yml`:
```yml
- name: o3-mini
  extra_params:
    api_key: this-key-is-used-by-the-bridge
    api_base: http://localhost:8000/v1/
```

Start aider with: `aider --model o3-mini`

#### 2. Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

Inference URL: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/ (default if omitted)

Configure in `~/.aider.model.settings.yml`:
```yml
- name: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
  streaming: false
  extra_params:
    max_tokens: 8192
    model: openai/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
    api_key: this-key-is-used-by-the-bridge
    api_base: http://localhost:8000/v1/
```

Start aider with: `aider --model anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`

**Note**: Streaming needs to be set to `false` currently due to a bug in the Anthropic OpenAI-compatible beta API.

### Important: Activating Tool Usage with #use-tools

By default, tools are NOT automatically used to reduce noise when you don't need them. To enable tool usage in your current LLM request, include the tag `#use-tools` in your message.

For example:
```
Hey Claude, can you search for recent news about AI? #use-tools
```

When tools are used, you can see the tool calls and their results in the terminal where the bridge is running. If you're experiencing issues with tool execution, check this terminal for error messages.

### Security Considerations

The bridge service runs locally on your machine on port 8000. While it requires API keys to use, exercise caution when running on shared networks. The bridge will forward your API key to the selected inference server.

### Multiple Bridge Instances

If you need to run multiple bridge instances simultaneously (for different inference servers), you'll need to modify the port for additional instances to avoid conflicts.

### Credits

The MCP-Bridge is based on the work from [SecretiveShell/MCP-Bridge](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-Bridge) with extensions to support additional servers like Anthropic's beta OpenAI-compatible endpoints. If you find this useful, please consider giving the original project a ⭐ on GitHub!
